Sorting Algorithm: that places an unsorted an unsorted at its suitable place in each iteration

We assume that the first card is already sorted then, we select an unsorted card. If the unsorted card is greater than the card in hand, it is placed on the right otherwise, to the left. In the same way, other unsorted cards are taken and put in their right place.
