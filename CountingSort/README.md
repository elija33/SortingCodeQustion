# SortingCodeQustion

Counting sort makes assumptions about the data, for example, it assumes that values are going to be in the range of 0 to 10 or 10 â€“ 99, etc, Some other assumption counting sort makes is input data will be all real numbers.
Like other algorithms this sorting algorithm is not a comparison-based algorithm, it hashes the value in a temporary count array and uses them for sorting.
It uses a temporary array making it a non-In Place algorithm.
